    # Locate bootstrap nodes from a DNS SRV record.
    #
    # @note This is experimental interface. It might change in future
    #       (e.g. service identifiers)
    #
    # The DNS SRV records need to be configured on a reachable DNS server. An
    # example configuration could look like the following:
    #
    #     _cbmcd._tcp.example.com.  0  IN  SRV  20  0  11210 node2.example.com.
    #     _cbmcd._tcp.example.com.  0  IN  SRV  10  0  11210 node1.example.com.
    #     _cbmcd._tcp.example.com.  0  IN  SRV  30  0  11210 node3.example.com.
    #
    #     _cbhttp._tcp.example.com.  0  IN  SRV  20  0  8091 node2.example.com.
    #     _cbhttp._tcp.example.com.  0  IN  SRV  10  0  8091 node1.example.com.
    #     _cbhttp._tcp.example.com.  0  IN  SRV  30  0  8091 node3.example.com.
    #
    # Now if "example.com" is passed in as the argument, the three
    # nodes configured will be parsed and put in the returned URI list. Note that
    # the priority is respected (in this example, node1 will be the first one
    # in the list, followed by node2 and node3). As of now, weighting is not
    # supported.
    #
    # @param name the DNS name where SRV records configured
    # @param bootstrap_protocol (Symbol) the desired protocol for
    #        bootstrapping. See +bootstrap_protocols+ option to
    #        {Couchbase::Bucket#new}. Allowed values +:http, :cccp+
    # @return a list of ordered boostrap URIs by their weight.
    #
    # @example Initialize connection using DNS SRV records
    #
    #    nodes = Couchbase::DNS.locate('example.com', :http)
    #    if nodes.empty?
    #      nodes = ["example.com:8091"]
    #    end
    #    Couchbase.connect(:node_list => nodes)
